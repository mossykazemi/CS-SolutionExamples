Note:
 for all these exercises, ignore input validation unless otherwise directed.
 Assume the user enters a value in the format that the program expects.
 For example, if the program expects the user to enter a number, don't worry 
about validating if the input is a number or not. When testing your program, simply enter a number.

**Here are the Questions :**

1- Write a program and ask the user to enter a number. The number should be between 1 to 10. 
If the user enters a valid number, display "Valid" on the console. Otherwise, display "Invalid".
 (This logic is used a lot in applications where values entered into input boxes need to be validated.)

2- Write a program which takes two numbers from the console and displays the maximum of the two.

3- Write a program and ask the user to enter the width and height of an image.Then tell if the image is landscape or portrait.
